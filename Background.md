# Background

This is an idea born out of a consistent market failure I've witnessed. There are plenty of qualified, professional and hard working people out of work. They have the right competencies with the wrong skills or industry experience. And a large number of open vacancies across almost all areas. 

Recruiters will often deal with at least fifty to one hundred job seekers for every one that they successfully put in a role. Often five to ten are out of work.

Companies and hiring teams are often unwilling to take a chance on someone who doesn't have a strong fit to the job requirements in terms of skills and industry. Out of job candidates often struggle with the stress of being out of work and performing well against often more comfortable employed candidates.

With the right recommendation at the right time to the right person, all of these issues can be overcome. More than 70% of hires happen via direct recommendation. 

The IbackU movement was founded on this principle. That recruiters can help people who are out of work find roles with companies that need people by referring them as good alternative candidates.

This movement also offers recruiters a simple way to do good while doing their job. Recruiters can help those professionals who are truly in need while building trusting relationships with clients and candidates.
