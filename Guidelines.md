# Guidelines

1. Recruiters must volunteer to "back" the job seeker who is out of work.
2. Job seekers are discouraged from directly asking a recruiter to back them. The referral has more meaning when it comes unsolicited from the recruiter. 
3. Recruiters back candidates who are **out of work**.
4. The introductions that the recruiter makes are given **without expectation of a fee** from either party. 
5. The job seeker must know which company they are being recommended to and be willing to have the introduction take place.
6. Job seekers must be open to completely different roles, retraining, different compensation structures, etc.
