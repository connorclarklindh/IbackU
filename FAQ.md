# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. Is my company okay with me doing this? 
  * You may need to ask. Direct your management to this webpage and encourage them to recognize the reputation benefits of making a social contribution part of the day to day job. 
2. I'm not a recruiter. Can I still refer people?
  * Of course. Most hires throughout history have been made by people referring people they know. You are welcome to spread the word about IbackU.
3. I've seen someone is spaming people using IbackU as a reason. What should I do? 
  * IbackU isn't a company or a business. Feel free to block anyone who abuses it. You can send them a link to this explanation if you like. I would just ignore them. The IbackU introductions which have meaning are those who come from people that you know - introducing people that you find interesting.
4. A job seeker keeps contacting me asking me to back them. What should I do?
  * If a candidate contacts you and requests that you act on their behalf, simply reply and remind them that the service is volunteer basis. If they continue to case you, you are welcome to ignore them/block them. The referral only has meaning when they are someone that you truely back.
