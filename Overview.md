# IbackU
IbackU is a template for open referrals by recruiters and others to help people who are out of work. This is not a job board or a place to send your resume/CV. It is an open set of template, instructions and tools for people interested in helping good people find jobs. 

Suggest changes, pull and otherwise utilise this content. Do attribute when it makes sense and post updates where you are using the content.

There is a job for anyone who is willing. The challenge is finding someone to back that person to learn the skills, make the move or otherwise apply themselves. 

IbackU is focused on helping good people, who want to work and reskill if necessary, find jobs via referrals and recommendations.
