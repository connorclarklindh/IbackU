# Job Seekers Advice

When you are out of work it can be a stressful and frustrating experience. Be respectful of recruiters and hiring companies that you speak with. They have their own stresses and often don't see how they can help you at first.

If you see that a recruiter that you are dealing with is part of the IbackU movement, ask them about it. They may be overwhelmed and unable to help. They may volunteer to back you. 

If the recruiter doesn't immediately volunteer to help, continue to contact hiring managers and recruiters. Always ask for referrals. You will eventually find a role or someone who is willing to help. 

Remember this is a service for job seekers who are out of work and willing to invest themselves in doing something different. Good people. Good professionals. Eager to change.
