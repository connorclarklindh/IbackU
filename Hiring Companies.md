# Hiring Companies Advice

IbackU introductions are made without any expectation of a fee. These are introudctions where the recruiter is backing an out-of-work candidate. This job seeker likely has a miss-match of skills to your company needs. Because this recruiter is backing them, you are encouraged to meet that candidate and give them a chance.

You are under no obligation to pay any recruitment fees for a IbackU introductions. You may choose to do so at your full discretion. As the introductions do not come with the burden of a fee, we hope that you will seriously consider meeting and speaking with the person introduced. The recruiter involved is taking a risk with their reputation by making this introduction. 

If the introductions result in a hire that you were planning to pay a recruitment fee for, we encourage you to donate at least 50% of that fee to a local charity focused on skill retraining and reemployment. Feel free to contact us if you aren't sure where to donate and we can make recommendations.
