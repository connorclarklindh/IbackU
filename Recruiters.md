# Recruiters Advice

The IbackU movement is based on volunteering to help out-of-work job seekers who you have met, know and feel comfortable introducing to a relevant selection of your clients or even other candidates that you think may be able to help them. 

Whether you volunteer to help a job seeker is your full discretion. We encourage you to volunteer regularly and help as many people as you can. You will need to notify someone that you are interested in helping them under the IbackU scheme. They need to confirm before going ahead.
